# Introduction
This is a course project for CSE594@SBU (and my first Ruby/Rails/JS/Slim travel).
Basically, it will process traceroute request and visualize the result for users.

Note that the traceroute requests are processed
by [RIPE Atlas](https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/measurement-creation-api).
So you need RIPE Atlas API keys to deploy this project.
Every request will cost several [credits](https://atlas.ripe.net/docs/credits/).

If you have no access to RIPE Atlas, you may still try to deploy the site as a
simple demo (with a little hack), in which you can paste your own traceroute
result and see the plotting on Google Maps.
